# Project Progress Log

This document summarizes the development progress of the Crypto Projects Screener.

## Backend Setup
- Initialized `uv` for dependency management.
- Initialized Git repository.
- Created base project directory structure: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `docs/`, `.cursor/rules/`.
- Populated `.gitignore` with common ignore patterns.
- Created a basic `README.md` file.
- Created `.cursor/rules/backend.mdc` and `frontend.mdc` for AI guidance.
- Added and installed backend dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `requests`, `python-dotenv`, `duckdb`, `polars`, `requests_cache`, `pytest`, `requests_mock`, `httpx`) using `uv`.
- Created `backend/src/main.py` for the FastAPI application.
- Created `backend/src/config.py` for API endpoints and API key loading.
- Created `backend/src/api/models.py` for Pydantic models.
- Created `backend/src/services/data_fetch.py` for API data fetching with caching.
- Created `backend/src/services/data_process.py` for data processing and merging.
- Created `backend/src/api/routes.py` to define API endpoints.
- Created `backend/tests/test_routes.py` for backend API testing.
- Configured `pytest.ini` and added `__init__.py` files to resolve import issues for testing.
- Successfully ran all backend tests.
- Fixed Python package structure by adding `__init__.py` files in all necessary directories.
- Updated imports to use relative imports throughout the codebase.
- Implemented proper data type handling in `data_process.py` for mixed data types.

## Frontend Setup
- Created `frontend/index.html` as the entry point, configured to load React and ReactDOM from CDNs.
- Created `frontend/src/App.jsx` as the main React component.
- Created placeholder components: `frontend/src/components/ProtocolTable.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/FilterPanel.jsx`, and `frontend/src/components/SearchBar.jsx`.
- Integrated the placeholder components into `App.jsx`.
- Updated `index.html` to use Babel Standalone for JSX transpilation.

## Issues Encountered & Current Status

- **Frontend `App.jsx` MIME Type Error**: The browser failed to load `App.jsx` because it was served with `text/jsx` MIME type instead of a JavaScript module type. This requires client-side transpilation.
  - **Resolution**: Updated `index.html` to use Babel Standalone for in-browser JSX transpilation.
  - **Status**: Fixed. Frontend now uses Babel Standalone for JSX transpilation.

- **Backend Import Issues**: Python module imports were failing due to incorrect package structure and import paths.
  - **Resolution**: Added `__init__.py` files and updated imports to use relative imports.
  - **Status**: Fixed. All imports now use relative paths correctly.

- **Backend Data Processing**: The Polars DataFrame creation for `protocols_data` failed due to mixed data types.
  - **Resolution**: Implemented proper type casting and null handling in `data_process.py`.
  - **Status**: Fixed. Data processing now handles mixed data types correctly.

## Next Steps

1. **Test Backend Endpoints**: Verify that all endpoints (`/`, `/protocols`, `/filters`) are working correctly.
2. **Implement Frontend Components**: Build out the React components with proper data fetching and display.
3. **Add Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for API calls and data processing.
4. **Add Loading States**: Implement loading states for data fetching operations.
5. **Add Tests**: Write comprehensive tests for both frontend and backend components.
